Sorry Iowa and New Hampshire. We tried, but the primary process is an unmitigated disaster. At the end of this tiresome marathon, we end up with a field of extremists, preaching to the base of the political parties. Primaries disenfranchise moderates, literally and figuratively. Non-partisans cannot vote in primaries in many states, and partisan candidates have no incentive to consider this constituency.

States in the west typically vote later in the primary season, so they have little impact on the selection process. Further, the candidates will become well versed in issues specific to the early primary states. Conversely, they give less time to issues and stances of quaint little places like, say, California.

"Caucuses" are even worse than primaries. Instead of results based on popular votes, caucuses work
more like an electoral college. In today's political climate, it's a recipe for even more extremism.

There should instead be one national primary with all candidates from all parties on the ballot, and the voter chooses only one candidate. The leader from each party, and the leading non-partisan, get on the ballot for the general election.

“Cross voting” would be a possible unintended consequence, where voters throw their votes to weak candidates from another party. Therefore, a national primary must create incentives for voters to vote directly for their candidates of choice. For example, the winner may get to chose more debate
formats than other candidates for the general election.

### But How?

I'm a software developer. I try to find ways to make things work, even when it looks difficult. The
primary system is written into state laws, making it difficult to change.

1. Keep every vote in play. Stay away from winner gets spoils results, like the electoral college.
2. Discourage partisanship.
3. Encourage visits to small states and retail politics.
4. Promote opportunity for lesser known, less-funded candidates.
