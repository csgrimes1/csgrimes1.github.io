<p>
I've intended for a long time to write a React application. I did not want to
do a "Hello World"; rather, I wanted something that interacts with external data.
</p>
<p>Rather than writing a server side application, I chose to use RSS feeds. They
    are freely available on the internet, and I added all the media outlets I could
    find a normal feed link for. There's just one little problem: CORS. My React
    application does a cross-site GET to retrieve a feed, and that's a deal breaker.
    Luckily, I found a CORS proxy I could use, and that solved the problem.
</p>
<p>
    So what good is CORS if all you need is a proxy to get around it? But I digress...
</p>
<p>The source code for the application can be viewed
     <a href="https://github.com/csgrimes1/react-feed" target="_blank">here</a>. I ran
    `npm build` and copied the artifacts in the `/build` directory here.</p>
